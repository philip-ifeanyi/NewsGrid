          <h3>Team News</h3>
          <p>The home team reverted to a back four after going three at the back last weekend in their 1 nil loss away to Manchester United with formal arsenal Goalie Lucas Fabianski starting in goal again. David Moyes made two changes to the team that lost last time out at Old Trafford with Mark Noble and Ben Johnson making way for Said Benrahma and the inform Jesse Lingard who sat out the visit to his parent club Man united in the last match.</p>
          <p>Mikel Arteta made few changes to his XI, Gabriel Magalhaes and Sedric Soares dropped out of the back four that featured from the start as Arsenal failed to keep clean sheet in the North London derby last weekend and is replaced by Pablo Mari and Calum Chambers respectively. In midfield, youngster Emile Smith Rowe dropped to the bench as Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is brought back into the XI following last week's absence due to issues related to late coming and upfront Alexandre Lacazette leads the line haven scored in the last match and boasting a fine record against todays opposition with 4 goals in his 6 matches against the Hammers.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>First Half</h3>
          <p>Arenal and Westham United played out an entertaining 3 all draw at the London Stadium on Sunday in what was a 50th meeting between the two capital giants and it was one for the neutrals. Westham was quick out of the blocks and by the just a little over the half hour mark, it looked as though they are going to put their city rivals to the sword as they already had a commanding THREE (3) GOAL lead thanks to some terrific play and horrendous defending by the visitors. First, Jesse Lingard drove a spectacular strike into the top corner before turning provider two minutes later as his quick taking of a freekick caught the Gunners off-guard and allowed Jarrod Bowen to drive home at the near post for the home team's second goal in less than three minutes.</p>
          <p>The home team continued to dominate and it was just a matter of time before they will get their third goal of the day. Tomas Soucek was on hand to divert a Michael Antonio header into the net to get his team's third and give them what looked like an unassailable lead in the 32nd minute. 
          The away team had hardly troubled the inform harmers until the 38th minute when Tomas Soucek turned in an Alexandre Lacazette strike into his own net to make it 3:1 and from that point the gunners seem to wake up and started putting together some great passes with Alexandre Lacazette, Calum Chambers who was making a rare start at RB, the Impressive Real Madrid loanee, M. Odegaard and Bukayo Saka who missed two great opportunities to add a second for his team before HT at the heart of everything for the away team who looked like they could concede a fourth just as they are capable grabbing a second themselves.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Second Half</h3>
          <p>The Gunners started the 2nd Half in determined fashion and Westham needed a goal line clearance from Center Back Isa Diop early on to deny Alexandre Lacazette a deserved goal after a fantastic run and pass from Calum Chambers. The away side continued to pile on the pressure and it told in the 61st minute when Craig Dawson smashed one of Calum Chambers crosses into his own net to make it 3:2, his 2nd own goal in the last two matches and his teams 2nd of the day. The Comeback is well and truly on the way?</p>
          <p>Westham had a sustained period of dominance midway through the 2nd Half with chances for Said Benrahma and Michael Antonio missing a great chance on the follow up and then hitting the post moments later. Somehow, they couldn't find a 4th goal to kill off their Neighbors from N5 who continued to threaten when they got forward. </p>
          <p>The gunners got their equalizer on the 82 minute when the impressive Alexandre Lacazette connected beautifully with a cross from substitute Nicolas Pepe to head home the delight of the away supporter who while not being allowed into the stadium due to COVID-19 protocols must have enjoyed watching their team pick up a point from a match they looked destined to lose by the 32nd minute. The final minutes saw chances at both ends as both teams tried to take all tree point with a mazy run the Hammers Captain Declan Rice ending with a rasping shot which Leno did well to beat away and Pepe missing a chance on the 86th minute to steal the points for the gunners after being put through by Odegaard.  There was no time for another as both teams settled for what would become just a 10th draw in the 50 premier league matches between them. The result means Westham head into the international break 5th on the log on 49 points and two points behind Chelsea who occupy the much sort after 4th position, they will return to action with a Monday night visit to the Molineux Stadium to lock horns with Wolves on the 5th of April. For Arsenal, the moved up to 9th on 42 points with their chances of finishing in the top 4 looking much slimmer than it was before kickoff on Sunday with them hosting the Champions Liverpool at the Emirates stadium next on super Sunday 3rd April.</p>
