          <p>Well the VR game is undoubtedly the most noticeable area, and others are also popular, like the virtual museum, music, gallery, virtual theme park, etc. The entertainment industry is one of the most enthusiastic applications of virtual reality and some believe that VR is set to be the future of entertainment.</p>
          <h2>VR tour of british museum</h2>
          <p>“A virtual museum is a digital entity that draws on the characteristics of a museum, in order to complement, enhance, or augment the museum experience through personalization, interactivity and richness of content.”</p>
          <p>Early in 2017, British Museum had launched a VR experience of British Museum, providing users an unparalleled digital experience by using computer or mobile device, and the chance to become fully immersed using a VR headset. It seems that British Museum was at your fingertips from anywhere in the world! The virtual way to visit museum can be very useful of changing attitudes towards museums and encourage more people to engage.</p>
          <h2>VR Art gallery</h2>
          <p>Google-owned Tilt Brush, a platform for artists to digitally sketch and create 3D content in a virtual reality environment, has launched its first art gallery in April, that allowed users to browse and share each other's 3D content.
          Though it cannot change the way galleries are running now, we can expect more art galleries in the near future and create more chances for people to take part in.</p>
          <h2>Virtual Theme park</h2>
          <p>The virtual reality theme parks have already seen easily. Get ready with goggles in theme parks. Virtual reality entertainment, with its computer generated sights and sounds that surround users, soon will transport park goers to places impossible to build. Virtual reality can create spaces that are too elaborate or fantastical to construct in real life and are scary and perilous. It also gives you characters that really are supernatural and paranormal, which sometimes we can't physically do.</p>
          <h2>Entertainment Future in VR</h2>
          <p>Virtual reality environments allow common people to engage with the exhibits, concerts, museum, gallery, etc. in ways which were previously unknown or forbidden. It allows the person to view 3D images and these images appear life-sized to the person, so the entertainment seems realistic but enjoyable.</p>
