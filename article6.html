            <h2>Orlando Bloom pens heartfelt essay after working with refugees at Ukrainian border</h2>
            <p>On February 24, 2022, the world woke up to shocking news: Russia had launched an attack on Ukraine. The Russian invasion was an imminent threat but, nonetheless, the attack came as a surprise. Reactions to the conflict started to appear soon after, particularly on social media, and many stars had a word to say about it as well.</p>
            <p>Orlando Bloom recently flew to Moldova in his capacity as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He spent his trip volunteering with Ukrainian mothers and children who had escaped the war by crossing the border into Moldova.</p>
            <p>Bloom was overwhelmed by what he saw there and wrote a heartfelt essay to share his experience. "As a father, I would do whatever it took to protect my children, yet I could barely begin to comprehend the devastating decisions these mothers were forced to make,” he explained, referring to the lengths many parents had to go to in order to get their children out of Ukraine safely. They fled their homes and the lives they had known to escape the bombing, risking everything to cross the border and reach what they hoped would be safety.</p>
            <p>Bloom also shared some important information from UNICEF: “Together, with the 2.5 million children internally displaced inside Ukraine, [the war has led to] one of the fastest large-scale displacements of children since World War II." He reflected on the fear and trauma that was changing the lives of so many children, and wondered what it would be like for his own kids "to suffer the pain and grief of losing their homes and everything they've ever known in a senseless instant.” Bloom finished his essay by recalling a small act of kindness from a local Moldovan man who came to bring toys to the refugee children, and hoped that small gestures such as this would help them make it through the crisis. </p>
