          <p>Karim Benzema stole the show once again as Real Madrid did just enough to eliminate Chelsea from the Champions League at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday night with a 5-4 aggregate win in their quarterfinal tie.<br>Carlo Ancelotti's side came into the match with the upper hand after riding a Benzema hat trick to a 3-1 win in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, and despite losing the second leg 3-2 to the Champions League holders, they advanced on aggregate.</p>
          <p>"We suffered a lot," Ancelotti said after the match. "We went 2-0 down without deserving it. With the first half we had, we created chances, we didn't have the hunger to go and score because we didn't need to, but for me 2-0 was undeserved. From there we dropped off a bit, and then the 3-0 liberated the team. I think over the 120 minutes we deserved it.
          "The 3-0 liberated us, from there the fans started to push, the magic of this stadium and this team came out again. We knew we had to suffer, it's normal, Chelsea are still a great team.
          "We have to be proud of what we've done, we played a very tough last 16 game against PSG, a very tough quarterfinal against Chelsea."
          Mason Mount put Chelsea ahead with 15 minutes played to give them hope of turning the tie around as the visitors dominated the first half. They went 2-0 up -- levelling the aggregate score -- after half-time when Antonio Rudiger headed in Mount's corner.
          Marcos Alonso had a goal disallowed by VAR for handball and Benzema hit the crossbar before Timo Werner beat Thibaut Courtois to make it 3-0, putting Chelsea ahead 4-3 on aggregate.</p>
          <p>Real Madrid came back to level matters soon after, when substitute Rodrygo beat Edouard Mendy from an exquisite cross into the area from Luka Modric to force extra time.
          Madrid made just one change from the first leg -- Nacho replacing the suspended Eder Militao at centre-back -- while Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel brought Alonso, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mateo Kovacic and Werner into his starting XI.</p>
