          <h2>Do you identify yourself as one of them?</h2>
          <p>You know the stereotype of a programmer â€” someone who's constantly tapping away on their keyboard, wearing headphones, and seldom participating in conversations unless asked. They are so focused on their work that they don't even notice when you walk into a room. <br>
          They are the quiet programmers I am talking about.</p>
          <p>Often people perceive them as shy or introverted. Such programmers are usually not considered the most promising contributors to the team. Many tag them as 'not a team player.' and get little visibility in a work culture where extroversion is the norm.</p>
          <p>However, in my experience, many of the most competent software developers I have worked with can be termed as 'quiet programmers.'. They don't hustle to grab attention. They have succeeded in their career purely based on their performance and contribution.</p>
          <p>Here are some excellent reasons why I consider quiet programmers the best.</p>
          <h2>1. quiet programmers understand the value of their words</h2>
          <p>It can be easy to get caught up in needing to do more, quicker, and louder in a fast-paced world. However, there is real value in taking the time to think and communicate thoughtfully.</p>
          <p>Many people think you need to be the loudest to be recognized as the smartest in the room. I have found from my experience that it is actually the opposite. People respect those who talk less but make worthy statements when they talk.</p>
          <p>When working on a team, it is also important to respect others' time and attention. A programmer who can take a step back, think before speaking, and deliver clear and concise messages is more likely to be respected and valued by their colleagues.</p>
          <p>Quiet programmers understand the above facts and put them into practice in their everyday work-life.</p>
